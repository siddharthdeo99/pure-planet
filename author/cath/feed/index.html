<p><strong>Zero Waste is an ethical lifestyle that is focused on reducing the amount of waste that one produces. There are many reasons why people live this way, but they all revolve around the idea of living in harmony with nature and reducing our impact on the environment for future generations. </strong>We are not only living in a time of climate change but are also producing more waste than ever before. So what can you do to minimize your environmental footprint?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start Small</strong></h2>



<p>It is unrealistic to expect to start living a zero-waste lifestyle overnight. It takes time to adapt to a new way of living, so go easy on yourself while you get used to a new way of doing things. One way to get started is to purchase reusable products where possible, like <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/">reusable shopping bags</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-facial-pads-white/" data-type="product" data-id="2141">makeup pads</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">earbuds</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">pegs</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mats</a> or <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-gold/" data-type="product" data-id="2134">straws</a>, for example. When possible, choose in-store items over items that have been delivered in plastic wrap or Styrofoam packaging. If you find yourself with leftovers from a meal, try to avoid using disposable utensils and containers for storing leftovers instead of using reusable containers. And lastly, try to reduce the number of plastics you use on a daily basis by buying food items that come in paper or cardboard packaging or even bring your own containers when shopping.</p>



<p>It is possible to live a zero-waste life, (well very close to zero). But it is impossible to live a zero-waste lifestyle without changing your way of thinking. In order to have a zero-waste lifestyle, you need to change some of the habits that have been instilled in you since childhood. It’s not an easy task but it can be done with some effort. Not every person will be able to adopt this lifestyle at first; it takes patience and determination.</p>



<p>The first major change that needs to happen is being able to differentiate between needs and wants. Do you need that new shirt, or do you just want it? The second major change that needs to happen is changing how you shop. You can shop for fresh produce at your local grocery store, purchase clothing at thrift stores instead of buying new clothes, or buy some high-quality items once and use them for years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Can I Reduce My Household Waste?</strong></h2>



<p>To start living a zero-waste lifestyle, the first thing you need to do is take an inventory of what&#8217;s in your trash can. If it&#8217;s mostly food scraps and paper products, then the next step would be to consider composting your food and paper waste. Composting is a natural process where microorganisms decompose organic matter and turn it into compost. It can be done at home using a compost bin or by spreading grass clippings and vegetable waste on your garden soil.</p>



<p>Composting is beneficial for the environment and does not contribute to greenhouse gases as it can help produce methane gas that has 25 times more capacity than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. This means that it traps more heat than carbon dioxide does, making it less detrimental to the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can I Avoid Fashion and Textile Waste?</h2>



<p>Another simple way to reduce waste is to consider shopping at second hand and thrift stores for clothes and other household items. These stores offer great deals and keep your dollars local, while also reducing the amount of waste in the environment. The average person throws away over 70 pounds of clothes each year. When we dispose of clothing, we are throwing away resources and money as well as adding to the world’s waste problem.</p>



<p>There are many ways you can reduce the amount of clothes that you throw away every year. One way is to take a closer look at what you already have in your closet before going out and buying something new. You may just find that what you have is perfect for the occasion or event! In addition to reducing waste, this strategy will also help save money!</p>



<p>Another way to reduce waste is by donating your used clothing instead of throwing them out. There are so many people who could use your old clothes for job interviews, special occasions etc.</p>



<p>While it is almost impossible to live a zero-waste life, there are ways that you can reduce the amount of waste you produce. The saying &#8220;reduce, reuse, recycle&#8221; is important when thinking about living a zero-waste life. Reducing the amount of waste you produce is one of the most effective ways to reduce your footprint. This can be done by shopping for items that are durable and reusable, stopping buying things that create unnecessary packaging, and choosing products with less toxic chemicals.</p>



<p>There are many ways to reduce your impact on the earth. By <strong>simply following some of our tips</strong>, you’ll be on track to living<strong> a more waste-free</strong> life with your family and friends!</p>
