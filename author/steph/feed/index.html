<p>Produce bags are a part of most people&#8217;s lives when they go to the grocery store. They are helpful in keeping certain fruits and vegetables together and are convenient when transporting your produce from the shop to your kitchen. However, they have been one of the major components to harm our environment and can also be harmful to our health as well. In this blog, we will discuss some of the main reasons why you need <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-produce-bags-5-pack/">reusable produce bags</a> in your life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Environment</h2>



<p>Of course, this is a very obvious point but still a very important one to make. The environment is impacted on a daily basis by many plastics around the world. Each time you take home plastic produce bags from the store, it is almost guaranteed to end up in either landfill or the ocean. By buying reusable bags, you are ensuring that plastic waste is reduced and think about it; if everybody switched to reusable bags that would reduce plastic pollution massively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Micro-Plastic</h2>



<p>Did you know that micro-plastic exists? Micro-plastic is produced from larger plastics which break into tiny particles because of photo-degradation and friction. Micro-plastic can leach into our food and into our digestive system. An interesting fact about micro-plastics is that once it is in our bodies, they can affect our health by damaging cells and causing inflammation in the body; this can also cause immune reactions in some cases. There have also been other health issues that have risen in recent decades from micro-plastics, yet researchers are still to do enough thorough research to confirm if this is caused by the micro-plastics. However, by using reusable bags, you are reducing your chances of micro-plastics entering the body!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Convenient</h2>



<p>So, we know that reusable bags are good for the environment and our health but another great thing about them is the convenience! Not only are they lightweight and easy to take anywhere with you but they can also hold 2kgs of produce per bag, most are made of breathable material for your produce which means that your produce will stay fresher for a longer period of time by preventing the air from becoming stagnant and they can be put in the washing machine to be cleaned or can be wiped down if needed. Another great thing about them is that they will last you years to even a lifetime if taken care of!</p>



<p>Itâ€™s safe to say that reusable produce bags are worth every dollar when you look at all the amazing benefits that come with them!
