<p>It&#8217;s that special time of year again, the time when family and friends are together celebrating the holiday season. By now you are probably thinking about decorating your home, what foods you&#8217;ll be supplying for your get-together or what gifts you are giving to your loved ones. While these questions are important, it is also important to think about how the decisions you make at this time of year may be impacting the environment. Not so surprisingly, this time of year is the most wasteful by an extra 30%! So, what can you do to change that might you ask? In this blog, we will go through 5 ways to make this Christmas eco-friendly without losing out on all the fun and good times this Christmas!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gifting</h2>



<p>GiftingGifting is usually at the top of everyone&#8217;s list when they think of Christmas, but a lot of the time, most gifts end up being picked last minute with not much thought put in. These gifts tend to be the ones that affect the planet the most! Instead of giving someone a gift with single-use plastics or poorly made products, opt for more eco-friendly options instead. Some alternatives could include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>An experience</strong><br>A day out to the zoo, skydiving or a dinner date; whatever experience you choose will usually be a big hit with the receiver and will be a gift that keeps on giving! These types of gifts will also have lasting memories but without the excessive amounts of wrapping paper and materials getting thrown in the bin at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Biodegradable or recyclable materials</strong><br>If you are wanting to get a gift like a toy, then opt for something that is made from biodegradable or recyclable materials. This will ensure that at the end of its life, it won&#8217;t be harmful to the environment!</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reusable products</strong><br>If you are wanting to get the perfect gift for your loved ones to open that won&#8217;t hurt the environment and will last years, then look at getting them eco-friendly reusable products for their home! From <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/">reusable travel cutlery sets</a> to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/">retractable metal straws</a> and even <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-makeup-remover-pads/">reusable make-up remover pads</a>, there are <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/bundles/">bundles</a> suitable for everyone. To check out some eco-friendly products, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/shop/">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christmas Tree</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like putting up the Christmas tree with your family, but many trees out there are cheap and only last a year or two. This can mean that you are constantly disposing of your old tree to buy a new one, and the same goes for the Christmas tree decorations too! To make this Christmas more eco-friendly, using these alternative trees can help the environment and help keep money in your pocket.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Felt Christmas Tree<br></strong>Felt Christmas trees can be really fun for the kids<strong>,</strong> plus you don&#8217;t get the added mess around your home that you usually would with a regular tree. The best part about the felt trees is that they can last a lifetime while also being able to add different themed decorations without throwing the old ones out!<br></li>



<li><strong>Real Tree</strong><br>An artificial tree cannot be recycled and can be harmful to the environment, but a real tree can be recycled, and while you&#8217;re at it, it also means you are supporting local businesses! While looking for a real Christmas tree, ensure that it has been sustainably grown!<br></li>



<li><strong>Potted tree</strong><br>If you have a green thumb, then buying a potted tree may be the way to go! By buying a small potted Christmas tree, you will be able to reuse it each year by repotting it, plus you get to say that you&#8217;ve grown the tree yourself!<br></li>



<li><strong>Eco-friendly Christmas decorations</strong><br>While you&#8217;re thinking about the tree, it is also important to think about the decorations you are going to put on it! Opting for reusable wooden decorations would be the way to go, but you can also find good quality baubles around too. It is best to go for the better quality baubles as these will be sure to last longer and cause less waste.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christmas Food</h2>



<p>Did you know that the main source of waste comes from the food, with roughly 5 million tonnes of food put into landfill each year at Christmas time which is 30% more waste than usual in Australia. Reducing the amount of food wasted can help the environment, but it can also be cheaper for you too. </p>



<p>A great way to reduce the amount of food wasted is to get each person to bring a plate of food to share that can be taken home or used the next day if it isn&#8217;t finished. Another alternative would be to plan ahead! If you can find out the number of people that would be coming over early on, you can plan how much food you&#8217;ll need, reducing the amount that gets wasted. If you are wanted to buy extra, just in case, it is best to buy something that can last a while on your shelf or in the freezer so the extra food won&#8217;t go to waste in case extra people don&#8217;t show up!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Paper</h2>



<p>Most wrapping paper cannot be recycled, yet many people don&#8217;t realise this. If you are wanting to wrap presents this year, then it&#8217;s best to get recycled wrapping paper to reduce the amount that goes into landfill. Another alternative would be to wrap presents with fabric instead of wrapping paper. Fabric can be used repeatedly while also looking great, with many colours and patterns to choose from.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reusable Advent Calendar</h2>



<p>Advent calendars are a hit with the kids but are often filled with plastic and sweets that will go into landfill and overhype the kiddies. By investing in a reusable advent calendar, you can reuse each year while also being able to choose what goes inside each box! From letters to gifts and even homemade sweets, the choices for filling the advent calendar is endless!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make This Christmas Eco-Friendly</h2>



<p>With these 5 ideas to make your Christmas eco-friendly, you&#8217;ll celebrate a more sustainable Christmas in no time! While you&#8217;re making your Christmas more eco-friendly, why not tell your family and friends so you can help the environment together?

<p>It is hard to think that one person can make a difference in the environment but you could be surprised. Taking small everyday steps can make a big impact! People often feel like they don&#8217;t have enough time or resources to help the environment but this simply isn&#8217;t the case. In this blog, we will go through some of the steps you can make each day to do your part in helping the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recycling</h2>



<p>Recycling is one of the easiest things you can do that can make such a big impact! When we recycle, we are limiting the amount of rubbish that goes into landfill while also providing materials to remake other things for someone else. The easiest way to remind yourself to recycle is to have a recycling bin at home. most things that are recyclable will have the logo on them so you can rest assured that you are recycling the right materials. The best part is, recycling has more than one benefit! Did you know that recycling can also help save energy? That&#8217;s right! When recycling properly, it can save energy because the process to recycle materials like aluminium uses roughly 95% less energy than if it were manufactured. Materials like metals can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by roughly 50% when recycled, and recycling plastic reduces the amount of petroleum used by around 80% which means it is also reducing fossil fuels. It&#8217;s easy to see why recycling is the biggest small everyday step you can make.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Donate</h2>



<p>If you find yourself booking a council clean-up or wanting to take things to the tip see if you can donate it first. There are many people who would find it useful or could do something with it. Some people like to upstyle old furniture while others are in need and would be very appreciative to receive these items. Some items could include clothes, furniture, toys and home appliances, however, you could almost donate anything! Other places that you could donate to are hospitals, refugees and homeless shelters. When you are donating your belongings instead of throwing them out, you are decreasing the amount of waste that becomes landfill.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make Better Purchase Choices</h2>



<p>Most of the time when people buy new home appliances they don&#8217;t think of anything else but how the appliance works. However, another thing people should be looking for is the energy star rating. A higher energy star rating means you won&#8217;t be using as much energy which also helps protect the environment. If you can get a second-hand appliance, it would be beneficial as that would create less waste than if you were to buy brand new. Other smart purchase choices you can make include things that can eventually be recycled or <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/shop/">reusable products</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buy Locally Grown Products</h2>



<p>One thing that can be done is to buy your products/produce locally! Not only will this reduce your carbon footprint but it will also be supporting local farmers and businesses. If you want to go one step further, you can even attempt to grow your own produce which means you know what&#8217;s going into the soil, you know the value of your products and you know that they won&#8217;t be sprayed with any nasties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Help The Environment</h2>



<p>While these may seem like some small steps, they can make a big difference long term. Why not start making your small steps today so we can work towards a better, brighter future together.

<p>Easter is a time when many people celebrate with family and friends. It can also be a very environmentally friendly holiday if you know how to do it right! In this blog post, we will give you some tips on how to have an eco-friendly easter. From using recycled eggs to picking up after your pet, we have you covered! Let&#8217;s make this easter the greenest one yet!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can we make Easter eco-friendly?</h2>



<p>One big step we can take is by ditching the plastic eggs and using eggs made of wood or paper instead. The wooden ones are great to reuse and will last many years if taken care of too which is a bonus! If you&#8217;re looking for a biodegradable option, go for the paper eggs. These can be composted after use and will break down within weeks. If you think you need to give up dying your eggs to be eco-friendly don&#8217;t worry, you can easily make your own natural food colouring too!</p>



<p>If the kids like having an easter egg basket for their easter egg hunt be sure to look for second-hand baskets before buying a new one or try to make your own! Many easter egg baskets end up in the bin at the end of the day and add to the growing amount of rubbish in our landfills. Making your own could be a great activity to do with the kids and will help the environment along the way! Another good alternative would be to skip the individually wrapped sweets altogether if possible! Get creative and think outside the box; there are many awesome things you can do instead!</p>



<p>Speaking of Easter egg hunts; another way to make easter eco-friendly is by picking up after your pet. This one may seem like common sense but many people forget to do it! Make sure to bring bags with you on your Easter egg hunt and pick up any messes your furry friend makes. This will help keep our parks and nature trails clean!</p>



<p>Do you like to decorate your home for Easter? This can be a fun activity you do every Easter however a lot of the time the decorations are ones that many buy for a one-use thing. A great way to make this tradition eco-friendly is by buying good quality easter decorations that you can re-use every year. This way you can continue enjoying these moments the eco-friendly way (it can also save you money)!</p>



<p>Another way to help the environment out this Easter would be to do eco-friendly arts and crafts instead! There are many awesome activities that you can do and we are sure the kids would love them too! You can make yummy treats in the kitchen with mum and dad, make dried flower eggs or even make flat origami easter cards for the family!</p>



<p>These are just a few of our eco-friendly Easter suggestions! We hope you have a great easter and remember to try out some of these tips this Easter!</p>
