										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Make the switch to sustainable living with our Eco beauty bundle. Included in this set is a retractable metal straw, a set of reusable make-up pads and more! With these products, you&#8217;ll be able to reduce your waste and help protect the environment.</p>
<p>This beauty bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/silver-retractable-metal-straw/">Silver Retractable Metal Straw</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">Reusable Earbuds</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>*Basket Not Included</strong></p>
<h4>Silver Retractable Metal Straw</h4>
<p>Retractable metal straw is a new and innovative product that is perfect for both kids and adults. They are made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground!</p>
<p>In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what’s not to love?! This collapsible design means it’s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it.</p>
<p>Cleaning couldn’t be easier, either: just unscrew to separate the brush while still attached to the straw! That double cleaning action makes for cleaner drinking – you don’t need all those germs in your mouth after all!</p>
<h4>Reusable Earbuds</h4>
<p>These environmentally-friendly Reusable Earbuds are designed to last 1000+ uses, and with their versatile design, it’s great for removing dirt yet soft enough to keep your sensitive areas clean. It even has one side specifically designed for makeup application – bonus points! All in all, this is the next big thing in bathroom products.</p>
<h4>Reusable Makeup Remover Pads</h4>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to take care of your skin without harming the environment, then our large reusable facial pads white are perfect for you!</p>
<p>These reusable facial pads replace the need for harmful single-use cotton pads and remove dirt, excess oils and makeup easily. Simply wet them and watch the magic happen as they wipe off makeup, dirt and grease in seconds.</p>
