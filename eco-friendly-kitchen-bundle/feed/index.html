					<description><![CDATA[My wife said she wanted to start making some eco-friendly changes around the house so we started by buying this bundle. I must say I am surprised at how well everything works! The baking mats have come in really handy and are so easy to clean. The silicone lids I was sceptical about but they are great, we use them the most that I will be buying more and the tote bag has come in handy when running down the road to get some needed fruit and veg. All in all I think the bundle is fantastic and definitely worth the money, we both recommend! ]]></description>
