										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking for simple and effective ways to reduce your environmental impact? One of the easiest and most impactful steps you can take is to switch to reusable products. By choosing durable and eco-friendly alternatives to single-use items, you can significantly reduce waste, save money, and support a cleaner, healthier planet.</p>
<h5>Here are three reusable products that are easy to incorporate into your daily routine:</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baking mats<br />
</strong>If you love baking, you know that parchment paper can quickly become a single-use item that generates a lot of waste. But there is a better alternative: silicone <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mats</a>. These durable mats are non-stick, easy to clean, and can be used over and over again. Simply place them on a baking sheet, and you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>
<p>Not only do baking mats save on waste, but they can also save you money in the long run. With proper care, a good quality baking mat can last for years, making it a worthwhile investment for any home baker.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Retractable metal straws<br />
</strong>Plastic straws are a major contributor to environmental pollution, with millions of them ending up in landfills and the ocean each year. But for those who prefer to use straws, there is a simple solution: <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/">retractable metal straws</a>.</p>
<p>These straws are made of durable and lightweight stainless steel and come with a compact carrying case, making them easy to bring with you wherever you go. Simply extend the straw when you need it, and retract it when you&#8217;re done. With proper care, metal straws can last for years, reducing the need for single-use plastic straws.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Travel cutlery sets<br />
</strong>Disposable plastic cutlery is another common source of waste, often used for take-out food or meals on the go. But there&#8217;s no need to rely on single-use items when you can bring your own <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/">travel cutlery set</a>.</p>
<p>These sets include a knife, fork, spoon, metal straw and a straw cleaner and are often made of lightweight and durable materials like stainless steel. They come with a compact carrying case, making them easy to bring with you wherever you go. By using your own cutlery, you can significantly reduce waste and save money on disposable options.</li>
</ol>
<p>Making the switch to reusable products is a simple but impactful step towards a more sustainable lifestyle. By incorporating products like <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mats</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/rose-gold-retractable-metal-straw/">retractable metal straws</a>, and <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/">travel cutlery sets</a> into your routine, you can significantly reduce waste, save money, and support a cleaner, healthier planet.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. There are countless other reusable products available, from reusable <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-makeup-remover-pads/">makeup removal pads</a> and <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-blue/">jumbo silicone straws</a> to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds-pink/">reusable earbuds</a> and <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-silicone-food-covers/">silicone food covers</a>. By choosing reusable products over single-use options, you can make a significant impact on the environment and support a more sustainable future.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As concern for the environment continues to grow in Australia, more and more people are looking for ways to reduce their impact on the planet. One simple yet effective way to do this is by using reusable products instead of disposable ones. In this blog, we will go through some of the products that can easily be swapped out for a reusable alternative.</p>
<h2><b>Metal Straws</b></h2>
<p>Metal straws are a great alternative to single-use plastic straws. It is estimated that 500 million plastic straws are used and discarded daily in the United States alone. These straws often end up in landfills or in the oceans, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose and can harm marine life. By using a <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/">reusable metal straw</a>, you can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment. Plus, metal straws are durable, easy to clean, and can be used over and over again, making them a great investment for those looking to live a more sustainable lifestyle in Australia.</p>
<h2><b>Baking Mat</b></h2>
<p>Another reusable product that can make a big impact is a <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mat</a>. These mats are made of silicone or other durable materials and can be used instead of disposable parchment paper or aluminium foil. Not only do they save money in the long run, but they also help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Plus, they are easy to clean and can be used for years to come.</p>
<h2><b>Metal Pegs</b></h2>
<p>Metal pegs are another great alternative to plastic ones in Australia. Traditional plastic pegs can break easily and often end up in the environment, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose. <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">Metal pegs</a>, on the other hand, are much more durable and can be used for years. They may cost a bit more upfront, but they will save you money in the long run and help to reduce waste in Australia.</p>
<h2><b>Travel Cutlery Sets</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/travel-accessories/">Travel cutlery sets</a> are another excellent way to reduce waste when eating on the go in Australia. Single-use plastic utensils are a major contributor to plastic pollution, and using a reusable set can help to reduce this problem. Many travel cutlery sets come with a fork, knife, spoon, and metal straw, making them a convenient and eco-friendly option for those who eat out often in Australia.</p>
<p>In addition to the environmental benefits, using reusable products can also help to save money in the long run in Australia. While the initial cost may be higher, these products are designed to be used over and over again, which can save you money in the long run. Plus, by using reusable products, you can help to reduce your overall consumption, which can lead to a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
<p>So next time you go to grab a disposable plastic straw or a sheet of parchment paper in Australia, consider opting for a reusable alternative instead. Every small change can make a big difference in the fight against plastic pollution and climate change in Australia.</p>
<p>As consumers, we have the power to make a positive impact on the environment by making conscious choices about the products we buy. By choosing reusable products, we can do our part to reduce waste and help create a more sustainable future for all in Australia. So don&#8217;t wait – start making the switch to reusable products today and join the movement towards a more sustainable tomorrow in Australia.

							<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The environmental impact of plastic waste is undeniable, particularly when it comes to disposable earbuds. Plastic cotton buds, also known as cotton buds or ear cleaners, are used for personal hygiene and discarded after a single use. These small items add up to a significant amount of plastic waste and are often found in oceans and other natural habitats, causing harm to wildlife and the environment. In this blog, we will outline why switching from disposable earbuds to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">reusable earbuds by Pure Planet</a> is important in reducing plastic waste and protecting our planet.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Are disposable earbuds polluting our oceans?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First, it&#8217;s essential to understand the scale of the problem. Plastic cotton buds are one of the top items found on beaches and in oceans, making up a significant amount of marine plastic pollution. These small, lightweight items are easily carried by the wind or washed into the sea by rainwater, where they can harm marine life and damage ecosystems. In addition, plastic cotton buds take hundreds of years to decompose and, over time, break down into smaller fragments, known as microplastics, which are just as harmful as larger pieces.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Secondly, it&#8217;s important to recognize that switching to reusable earbuds, such as those offered by Pure Planet, is a simple and effective solution to the problem of plastic waste. <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">Eco Essential reusable earbuds</a> are made of sustainable materials like silicone and can be washed and used multiple times. This not only reduces the amount of plastic waste but also provides a more sustainable and eco-friendly option for personal hygiene. Furthermore, reusable earbuds can be an economic benefit. Disposable earbuds are often cheaper than <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds-green/">reusable ones</a>, but the economic benefit of reducing pollution, protecting natural resources, and cleaning costs can more than cover the small additional cost.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How can I make the switch in my daily routine?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Switching from disposable cotton and plastic earbuds to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds-pink/">reusable earbuds</a> for cleaning your ears and applying make-up can be easy and beneficial for the environment. Here are a few simple steps to help you make the transition:</span></p><ol><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Start by purchasing a pack of <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">high-quality reusable earbuds from Pure Planet.</a> They are specifically designed for ear cleaning and make-up application. They come in different shapes and sizes for various uses.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Begin using your reusable silicone earbuds for cleaning your ears and applying make-up as you would typically do with cotton and plastic earbuds. You will find out that it will be more gentle and effective in removing ear wax and more precise for make-up application.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you get used to using reusable earbuds, start to phase out the disposable cotton and plastic earbuds. You can start using the <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds-pink/">reusable earbuds</a> for one ear or for make-up application on one side of the face and then slowly transition to using them for both ears or both sides of the face.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Keep your reusable earbuds clean by washing them with mild soap and warm water after each use. They are also dishwasher safe which makes them even more convenient.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By switching to reusable silicone earbuds, you&#8217;ll reduce your environmental impact and save money in the long run and enjoy the benefits of more comfortable, effective and precise cleaning and make-up application.</span></li></ol><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Remember that when it comes to ear hygiene, you must consult your doctor if you have chronic ear issues such as infections, blockages or pains.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We can all do our part to help the environment. </span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can make a difference by switching to reusable earbuds, encouraging friends and family to do the same, and supporting companies that are making substantial efforts to reduce plastic usage. Businesses can also play a role by offering reusable earbuds as an alternative to disposable ones and promoting their use. Governments can encourage the transition by implementing policies and regulations to phase out disposable earbuds and promote sustainable alternatives.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In conclusion, disposable earbuds significantly contribute to plastic pollution and cause harm to our planet and its inhabitants.  We all must take responsibility for our actions and consider sustainable alternatives. By switching to Eco Essential reusable earbuds, we can reduce plastic waste and positively impact our planet&#8217;s health. Grab your set of reusable earbuds today and you will never want to use disposable ones again!</span></p><p> </p>						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s that special time of year again, the time when family and friends are together celebrating the holiday season. By now you are probably thinking about decorating your home, what foods you&#8217;ll be supplying for your get-together or what gifts you are giving to your loved ones. While these questions are important, it is also important to think about how the decisions you make at this time of year may be impacting the environment. Not so surprisingly, this time of year is the most wasteful by an extra 30%! So, what can you do to change that might you ask? In this blog, we will go through 5 ways to make this Christmas eco-friendly without losing out on all the fun and good times this Christmas!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gifting</h2>



<p>GiftingGifting is usually at the top of everyone&#8217;s list when they think of Christmas, but a lot of the time, most gifts end up being picked last minute with not much thought put in. These gifts tend to be the ones that affect the planet the most! Instead of giving someone a gift with single-use plastics or poorly made products, opt for more eco-friendly options instead. Some alternatives could include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>An experience</strong><br>A day out to the zoo, skydiving or a dinner date; whatever experience you choose will usually be a big hit with the receiver and will be a gift that keeps on giving! These types of gifts will also have lasting memories but without the excessive amounts of wrapping paper and materials getting thrown in the bin at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Biodegradable or recyclable materials</strong><br>If you are wanting to get a gift like a toy, then opt for something that is made from biodegradable or recyclable materials. This will ensure that at the end of its life, it won&#8217;t be harmful to the environment!</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reusable products</strong><br>If you are wanting to get the perfect gift for your loved ones to open that won&#8217;t hurt the environment and will last years, then look at getting them eco-friendly reusable products for their home! From <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/">reusable travel cutlery sets</a> to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/">retractable metal straws</a> and even <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-makeup-remover-pads/">reusable make-up remover pads</a>, there are <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/bundles/">bundles</a> suitable for everyone. To check out some eco-friendly products, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/shop/">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christmas Tree</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like putting up the Christmas tree with your family, but many trees out there are cheap and only last a year or two. This can mean that you are constantly disposing of your old tree to buy a new one, and the same goes for the Christmas tree decorations too! To make this Christmas more eco-friendly, using these alternative trees can help the environment and help keep money in your pocket.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Felt Christmas Tree<br></strong>Felt Christmas trees can be really fun for the kids<strong>,</strong> plus you don&#8217;t get the added mess around your home that you usually would with a regular tree. The best part about the felt trees is that they can last a lifetime while also being able to add different themed decorations without throwing the old ones out!<br></li>



<li><strong>Real Tree</strong><br>An artificial tree cannot be recycled and can be harmful to the environment, but a real tree can be recycled, and while you&#8217;re at it, it also means you are supporting local businesses! While looking for a real Christmas tree, ensure that it has been sustainably grown!<br></li>



<li><strong>Potted tree</strong><br>If you have a green thumb, then buying a potted tree may be the way to go! By buying a small potted Christmas tree, you will be able to reuse it each year by repotting it, plus you get to say that you&#8217;ve grown the tree yourself!<br></li>



<li><strong>Eco-friendly Christmas decorations</strong><br>While you&#8217;re thinking about the tree, it is also important to think about the decorations you are going to put on it! Opting for reusable wooden decorations would be the way to go, but you can also find good quality baubles around too. It is best to go for the better quality baubles as these will be sure to last longer and cause less waste.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christmas Food</h2>



<p>Did you know that the main source of waste comes from the food, with roughly 5 million tonnes of food put into landfill each year at Christmas time which is 30% more waste than usual in Australia. Reducing the amount of food wasted can help the environment, but it can also be cheaper for you too. </p>



<p>A great way to reduce the amount of food wasted is to get each person to bring a plate of food to share that can be taken home or used the next day if it isn&#8217;t finished. Another alternative would be to plan ahead! If you can find out the number of people that would be coming over early on, you can plan how much food you&#8217;ll need, reducing the amount that gets wasted. If you are wanted to buy extra, just in case, it is best to buy something that can last a while on your shelf or in the freezer so the extra food won&#8217;t go to waste in case extra people don&#8217;t show up!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Paper</h2>



<p>Most wrapping paper cannot be recycled, yet many people don&#8217;t realise this. If you are wanting to wrap presents this year, then it&#8217;s best to get recycled wrapping paper to reduce the amount that goes into landfill. Another alternative would be to wrap presents with fabric instead of wrapping paper. Fabric can be used repeatedly while also looking great, with many colours and patterns to choose from.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reusable Advent Calendar</h2>



<p>Advent calendars are a hit with the kids but are often filled with plastic and sweets that will go into landfill and overhype the kiddies. By investing in a reusable advent calendar, you can reuse each year while also being able to choose what goes inside each box! From letters to gifts and even homemade sweets, the choices for filling the advent calendar is endless!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make This Christmas Eco-Friendly</h2>



<p>With these 5 ideas to make your Christmas eco-friendly, you&#8217;ll celebrate a more sustainable Christmas in no time! While you&#8217;re making your Christmas more eco-friendly, why not tell your family and friends so you can help the environment together?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recycling is the process of collecting certain materials that would otherwise be thrown away as rubbish and turning them into something new. When people don&#8217;t recycle, that rubbish ends up in landfill or in our oceans when it could have become something new for someone else. Coming to this realisation, it&#8217;s important to understand why recycling is so important for our planet! With that in mind, we understand that starting your recycling journey may be quite confusing, what can be recycled? Do I have to wash my rubbish before throwing it? In this blog, we will go through tips to start your recycling journey the right way!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Benefits Of Recycling?</h2>



<p>One of the benefits which we have already mentioned is that the rubbish doesn&#8217;t end up in landfill and in our oceans. This also helps to conserve all the natural resources such as water, minerals and timber to name a few. Another benefit includes reducing pollution and greenhouse gases by decreasing the amount of new raw materials needed to make new things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can Be Recycled?</h2>



<p>So, you want to start recycling, you understand the benefits but you don&#8217;t know what can be recycled. That&#8217;s okay, we all start somewhere! There are many things that are 100% recyclable and can be thrown straight in the recycling bin but there are also some things that are not meant for recycling or are only partially recyclable, because of this, we have made a list of what is able to be recycled to help you!</p>



<p>All paper and cardboard are recyclable, this includes things like boxes (including pizza boxes if there are no leftovers in them), phone books, letters and envelopes, newspapers and old books or magazines. There are also some kitchen containers and some food packaging that can be recycled. Some of these include bottles and mason jars that are made from glass, food containers that are made from plastic, all water bottles and soft drink bottles that are made of plastic, all soft drink cans and other aluminium or steel cans and tins, juice bottles or milk cartons and even aerosol cans.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Upcycling?</h2>



<p>If you have some old things at home that you no longer need or want you can decide to recycle them by upcycling it! Upcycling is turning your old things into something that you can use for a new purpose. Some ideas could include making gardening pots out of plastic water bottles. All you need to do is cut it down to size and you have yourself a new gardening pot! Another awesome upcycle is making your tin cans into kitchen utensil holders or arts and crafts holders! There is an endless amount of possibilities that can come from upcycling and it reduces the impact on the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Live A More Sustainable Lifestyle</h2>



<p>By reducing your impact on the environment by recycling, you are taking one step closer towards a more sustainable lifestyle. Another great step would be to buy smarter by replacing your one-use items with reusable items in your household which creates less waste.

<p>It is hard to think that one person can make a difference in the environment but you could be surprised. Taking small everyday steps can make a big impact! People often feel like they don&#8217;t have enough time or resources to help the environment but this simply isn&#8217;t the case. In this blog, we will go through some of the steps you can make each day to do your part in helping the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recycling</h2>



<p>Recycling is one of the easiest things you can do that can make such a big impact! When we recycle, we are limiting the amount of rubbish that goes into landfill while also providing materials to remake other things for someone else. The easiest way to remind yourself to recycle is to have a recycling bin at home. most things that are recyclable will have the logo on them so you can rest assured that you are recycling the right materials. The best part is, recycling has more than one benefit! Did you know that recycling can also help save energy? That&#8217;s right! When recycling properly, it can save energy because the process to recycle materials like aluminium uses roughly 95% less energy than if it were manufactured. Materials like metals can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by roughly 50% when recycled, and recycling plastic reduces the amount of petroleum used by around 80% which means it is also reducing fossil fuels. It&#8217;s easy to see why recycling is the biggest small everyday step you can make.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Donate</h2>



<p>If you find yourself booking a council clean-up or wanting to take things to the tip see if you can donate it first. There are many people who would find it useful or could do something with it. Some people like to upstyle old furniture while others are in need and would be very appreciative to receive these items. Some items could include clothes, furniture, toys and home appliances, however, you could almost donate anything! Other places that you could donate to are hospitals, refugees and homeless shelters. When you are donating your belongings instead of throwing them out, you are decreasing the amount of waste that becomes landfill.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make Better Purchase Choices</h2>



<p>Most of the time when people buy new home appliances they don&#8217;t think of anything else but how the appliance works. However, another thing people should be looking for is the energy star rating. A higher energy star rating means you won&#8217;t be using as much energy which also helps protect the environment. If you can get a second-hand appliance, it would be beneficial as that would create less waste than if you were to buy brand new. Other smart purchase choices you can make include things that can eventually be recycled or <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/shop/">reusable products</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buy Locally Grown Products</h2>



<p>One thing that can be done is to buy your products/produce locally! Not only will this reduce your carbon footprint but it will also be supporting local farmers and businesses. If you want to go one step further, you can even attempt to grow your own produce which means you know what&#8217;s going into the soil, you know the value of your products and you know that they won&#8217;t be sprayed with any nasties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Help The Environment</h2>



<p>While these may seem like some small steps, they can make a big difference long term. Why not start making your small steps today so we can work towards a better, brighter future together.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Produce bags are a part of most people&#8217;s lives when they go to the grocery store. They are helpful in keeping certain fruits and vegetables together and are convenient when transporting your produce from the shop to your kitchen. However, they have been one of the major components to harm our environment and can also be harmful to our health as well. In this blog, we will discuss some of the main reasons why you need <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-produce-bags-5-pack/">reusable produce bags</a> in your life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Environment</h2>



<p>Of course, this is a very obvious point but still a very important one to make. The environment is impacted on a daily basis by many plastics around the world. Each time you take home plastic produce bags from the store, it is almost guaranteed to end up in either landfill or the ocean. By buying reusable bags, you are ensuring that plastic waste is reduced and think about it; if everybody switched to reusable bags that would reduce plastic pollution massively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Micro-Plastic</h2>



<p>Did you know that micro-plastic exists? Micro-plastic is produced from larger plastics which break into tiny particles because of photo-degradation and friction. Micro-plastic can leach into our food and into our digestive system. An interesting fact about micro-plastics is that once it is in our bodies, they can affect our health by damaging cells and causing inflammation in the body; this can also cause immune reactions in some cases. There have also been other health issues that have risen in recent decades from micro-plastics, yet researchers are still to do enough thorough research to confirm if this is caused by the micro-plastics. However, by using reusable bags, you are reducing your chances of micro-plastics entering the body!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Convenient</h2>



<p>So, we know that reusable bags are good for the environment and our health but another great thing about them is the convenience! Not only are they lightweight and easy to take anywhere with you but they can also hold 2kgs of produce per bag, most are made of breathable material for your produce which means that your produce will stay fresher for a longer period of time by preventing the air from becoming stagnant and they can be put in the washing machine to be cleaned or can be wiped down if needed. Another great thing about them is that they will last you years to even a lifetime if taken care of!</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that reusable produce bags are worth every dollar when you look at all the amazing benefits that come with them! If you would like to read more about or purchase the 5 pack of reusable produce bags, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-produce-bags-5-pack/">click here</a>. Alternatively, our cotton tote bag also has great benefits and can be found <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/">here</a>. </p>

<p id="14e41211-95e7-4dc6-ab37-c2d89497c939">In an effort to reduce plastic pollution, the New South Wales (NSW) government has announced a ban on single-use plastics. This is great news for the environment, and it&#8217;s something that we should all be getting behind. In this blog post, we will discuss what this means for NSW residents and businesses, what you need to know and how you can do your part to help reduce plastic pollution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the single-use plastics ban mean for my business?</h2>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">I know it can be convenient to buy cheap plastic takeaway cutlery, straws and bags for your customers and now you may be wondering what your business will do without them. The good news is that you can still do that but with non-plastic equivalents like paper straws and cutlery. This can also be an opportunity to encourage your customers to bring their own reusable utensils and bags for a percent off the purchase price or sell your own <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reusable straws</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cutlery sets</a> and <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">bags</a> to customers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the ban mean for individuals?</h2>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">Now is the perfect time to start thinking of reusable alternatives that are easy and convenient to take with you. Not only will that take the stress out of finding utensils and bags on the go, but it will also reduce the stress on the environment so it&#8217;s a win-win! Another great thing about having your reusable utensils with you at all times means it will cost you less in the long run, what&#8217;s not to love about saving money?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, what next?</h2>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">The NSW government&#8217;s ban on single-use plastics is a great step in the right direction but we all need to do our part to reduce plastic pollution. Here are some things you can do to help:</p>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">• Bring your own reusable bags, straws and utensils when you go out</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Avoid purchasing products with excessive packaging</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Recycle all the plastic you can</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Volunteer for or donate to organisations that are working to reduce plastic pollution</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">We hope this blog post has given you some useful information about the NSW government&#8217;s ban on single-use plastics. Do your part to help reduce plastic pollution and make sure to spread the word!

<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Plastic is polluting our planet and it&#8217;s time for all of us to do our part in reducing its impact. If you&#8217;re looking for ways to make your lifestyle more environmentally friendly, switching to a plastic-free lifestyle is a great place to start! In this blog post, we will discuss some tips for making the switch and how being environmentally friendly can benefit you and the planet. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Did you know that plastic not only takes up to 500 years to decompose but it also spreads toxins and is harming our wildlife? When you think of environmentally friendly what do you think of? We want to do our part in reducing the global warming which is affected by plastics and we want to help nature, wildlife and ourselves. Getting rid of unnecessary plastics in your home and workplace would be the best place to start.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking care of your health</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Many people don&#8217;t realise it, but studies have shown that plastics can actually leach chemicals into our food and drinks. This can have an effect on your health and can even cause issues with your immunity, can cause cancers and has even been linked to birth defects.</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Surprisingly, plastics have even been found in human waste and some types of foods and drinks that we consume. Unfortunately, our stomachs cannot break down plastics so this will in fact come out the other end and may cause health issues that can stay with us for a while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking care of wildlife</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Our wildlife suffers greatly from our plastic use which has caused a deadly effect on many creatures. Many of these creatures are a part of our sea life and can be caused by ingesting it or getting tangled in it. The worst part is that it isn&#8217;t surprising as there are currently roughly 51 trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans. If everyone could have a plastic-free lifestyle, our marine life and oceans may eventually get healthier but for now, we need to all do our part in encouraging others to help save our oceans.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Switching to a plastic-free lifestyle</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So you may be thinking &#8220;yes, I want to help my health and our wildlife but how?&#8221;, well firstly you could switch out your usual plastic products! There are now many reusable alternatives you could buy to replace your everyday plastic items and most of the time it ends up being cheaper than buying plastics repeatedly. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the products;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Straws</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Straws have such a big impact on our environment and are one of the main products found in our waterways. There are now so many different alternatives to plastic straws so it&#8217;s safe to say that everyone has a choice on which one they would prefer. Here are a few options now available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Retractable metal straws</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-black/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">metal straws</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-blue/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Silicone Straws</a></li><li>Paper straws</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cutlery</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So, you&#8217;re on the road and maybe getting takeaway for lunch, the takeaway comes with plastic cutlery and eventually ends up in the landfill. Not the best situation but luckily we are taking steps to change it. Again there are different alternatives to plastic cutlery so we don&#8217;t have to add to the environmental impacts of plastics anymore! Here are a few options available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Travel Cutlery Set</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/cutlery-travel-pouch/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cutlery travel pouch</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pegs</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Plastic pegs are history with the new options available to replace them! We don&#8217;t need another thing added to our landfill and we don&#8217;t need to keep running down the road because our pegs keep breaking either. Here are a few options available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metal pegs</a></li><li>Timber pegs</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Self-care</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Make-up wipes and earbuds are other products that make their way into our oceans and landfill. It not only impacts our environment but they can both be harsh on our skin too. Some options available include;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-makeup-remover-pads/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reusable make-up remover pads</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reusable earbuds</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen products</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">We need to bake, we get out baking paper. We need to put food away, we get out cling wrap. We go shopping, we get out our plastic bags. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t think about these products and how they can also have an impact on the environment. There are some alternatives to these products with more eco-friendly products coming out to replace these every day! Some of the alternative choices available include;</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://non-stick%20baking%20mat/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Non-stick Baking mat</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tote bag</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-silicone-food-covers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Silicone food covers</a></li><li>produce bags</li></ul>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Some big changes are coming in NSW with the government banning single-use plastics in June to phase out all single-use plastics by November 2022. This is exciting news for all the people that would like to help reduce our impact on the environment but let&#8217;s take it one step further by replacing all single-use items that we can with reusable products instead to reduce our overall waste.</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So you have some options to get you started on your plastic-free lifestyle. What steps are you going to start taking to take better care of yourself and your environment? If you have any questions or even other eco-friendly products in mind that you would like to see more of, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/contact/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">contact us</a>!</p>

<p>Easter is a time when many people celebrate with family and friends. It can also be a very environmentally friendly holiday if you know how to do it right! In this blog post, we will give you some tips on how to have an eco-friendly easter. From using recycled eggs to picking up after your pet, we have you covered! Let&#8217;s make this easter the greenest one yet!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can we make Easter eco-friendly?</h2>



<p>One big step we can take is by ditching the plastic eggs and using eggs made of wood or paper instead. The wooden ones are great to reuse and will last many years if taken care of too which is a bonus! If you&#8217;re looking for a biodegradable option, go for the paper eggs. These can be composted after use and will break down within weeks. If you think you need to give up dying your eggs to be eco-friendly don&#8217;t worry, you can easily make your own natural food colouring too!</p>



<p>If the kids like having an easter egg basket for their easter egg hunt be sure to look for second-hand baskets before buying a new one or try to make your own! Many easter egg baskets end up in the bin at the end of the day and add to the growing amount of rubbish in our landfills. Making your own could be a great activity to do with the kids and will help the environment along the way! Another good alternative would be to skip the individually wrapped sweets altogether if possible! Get creative and think outside the box; there are many awesome things you can do instead!</p>



<p>Speaking of Easter egg hunts; another way to make easter eco-friendly is by picking up after your pet. This one may seem like common sense but many people forget to do it! Make sure to bring bags with you on your Easter egg hunt and pick up any messes your furry friend makes. This will help keep our parks and nature trails clean!</p>



<p>Do you like to decorate your home for Easter? This can be a fun activity you do every Easter however a lot of the time the decorations are ones that many buy for a one-use thing. A great way to make this tradition eco-friendly is by buying good quality easter decorations that you can re-use every year. This way you can continue enjoying these moments the eco-friendly way (it can also save you money)!</p>



<p>Another way to help the environment out this Easter would be to do eco-friendly arts and crafts instead! There are many awesome activities that you can do and we are sure the kids would love them too! You can make yummy treats in the kitchen with mum and dad, make dried flower eggs or even make flat origami easter cards for the family!</p>



<p>These are just a few of our eco-friendly Easter suggestions! We hope you have a great easter and remember to try out some of these tips this Easter!</p>
