<p>Do you know how many makeups wipes the average person uses in their lifetime? For most people, it is about 1000.

If you want to save some cash while also being kinder to the environment, try our reusable facial pads!</p>
<p>You might be a big fan of the convenience of disposable facial wipes, but the environment is not! We only use them for a couple of seconds, but they go on to live in landfill for hundreds of years, leaking toxic chemicals into our water and soil.</p>
<p>Single-use cotton pads and wipes may have been the only convenient solution a couple of years ago, but that&#8217;s no longer the case! Our reusable facial pads are not only more convenient, they are affordable. Plus you can rest assured that you won&#8217;t ever get caught with nothing to clean your face ever again.</p>
<p>Single-use facial pads contain harsh chemicals that can dry out and irritate your skin. With these reusable facial pads, your skin will thank you for only using water to cleanse your skin.</p>
<p>When you try these reusable pads that can be rinsed clean after each use, it will be a game-changer. With these Reusable Facial Pads White, you don&#8217;t have to worry about spending extra money on expensive makeup removers or facial wipes because you will always have these Pure Planet pads on hand in the bathroom.</p>
<p>And best of all, these Reusable Facial Pads White come in a set of three so you always have one clean! Simply toss it in the wash when dirty and use it again! They also come with a reusable carrying pouch, so you&#8217;ll never lose them.</p>
<p>So go ahead give these Reusable Facial Pads White a try today and see how much better your skin will feel tomorrow, not to mention the planet will thank you for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Reusable Makeup Remover Pads &#8211; Black</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a way to take care of your skin without harming the environment, then our large reusable facial pads are perfect for you! These reusable facial pads replace the need for harmful single-use cotton pads and remove dirt, excess oils and makeup easily. Simply wet them and watch the magic happen as they wipe off makeup, dirt and grease in seconds. The microfiber material makes for an effective cleaning tool because the fibres are positively charged. Oil and Dirt are negatively charged so they are literally attracted to microfiber like a magnet. Our reusable facial pads are 11cm, so you&#8217;ll catch all the dirt from your face with just one pad instead of using multiple wipes.</p>
<p>Not only are these facial pads better for the environment, but they are also great for your wallet! Never buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_wipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeup wipes</a> or cotton pads again! You’ll love how soft and gentle this product is on your skin, not a single thing will irritate you! Our reusable facial pads are a total game-changer. This is not an ordinary makeup remover, this one will leave you feeling soft and smooth. Suitable for all skin types, especially sensitive skin! Reusable Facial Pads 3pk Black are all-natural and chemical-free.</p>
<p>Do you know how many makeups wipes the average person uses in their lifetime? For most people, it is about 1000. That adds up to a lot of money spent on facial wipes and pads that are used once and then thrown away. If you want to save some cash while also being kinder to the environment, try our reusable facial pads!</p>
<p>You might be a big fan of the convenience of disposable facial wipes, but the environment is not! We only use them for a couple of seconds, but they go on to live in landfill for hundreds of years, leaking toxic chemicals into our water and soil.</p>
<p>Single-use cotton pads and wipes may have been the only convenient solution a couple of years ago, but that&#8217;s no longer the case! Our Reusable Makeup Remover Pads are not only more convenient, but they are also affordable. Plus you can rest assured that you won&#8217;t ever get caught with nothing to clean your face ever again.</p>
<p>Single-use facial pads contain harsh chemicals that can dry out and irritate your skin. With these <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-facial-pads-white/">Reusable Makeup Remover Pads</a>, your skin will thank you for only using water to cleanse your skin.</p>
<p>When you try the Reusable Facial Pads 3pk Black, which can be rinsed clean after each use, it will be a game-changer. With these pads, you don&#8217;t have to worry about spending extra money on expensive makeup removers or facial wipes because you will always have these Pure Planet pads on hand in the bathroom.</p>
<p>And best of all, these Reusable Makeup Remover Pads come in a set of three so you always have one clean! Simply toss it in the wash when dirty and use it again! They also come with a reusable carrying pouch, so you&#8217;ll never lose them.</p>
<p>So go ahead give these reusable facial pads a try today and see how much better your skin will feel tomorrow, not to mention the planet will thank you for it!</p>
