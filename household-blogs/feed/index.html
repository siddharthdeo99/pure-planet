										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As concern for the environment continues to grow in Australia, more and more people are looking for ways to reduce their impact on the planet. One simple yet effective way to do this is by using reusable products instead of disposable ones. In this blog, we will go through some of the products that can easily be swapped out for a reusable alternative.</p>
<h2><b>Metal Straws</b></h2>
<p>Metal straws are a great alternative to single-use plastic straws. It is estimated that 500 million plastic straws are used and discarded daily in the United States alone. These straws often end up in landfills or in the oceans, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose and can harm marine life. By using a <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/">reusable metal straw</a>, you can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment. Plus, metal straws are durable, easy to clean, and can be used over and over again, making them a great investment for those looking to live a more sustainable lifestyle in Australia.</p>
<h2><b>Baking Mat</b></h2>
<p>Another reusable product that can make a big impact is a <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mat</a>. These mats are made of silicone or other durable materials and can be used instead of disposable parchment paper or aluminium foil. Not only do they save money in the long run, but they also help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Plus, they are easy to clean and can be used for years to come.</p>
<h2><b>Metal Pegs</b></h2>
<p>Metal pegs are another great alternative to plastic ones in Australia. Traditional plastic pegs can break easily and often end up in the environment, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose. <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">Metal pegs</a>, on the other hand, are much more durable and can be used for years. They may cost a bit more upfront, but they will save you money in the long run and help to reduce waste in Australia.</p>
<h2><b>Travel Cutlery Sets</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/travel-accessories/">Travel cutlery sets</a> are another excellent way to reduce waste when eating on the go in Australia. Single-use plastic utensils are a major contributor to plastic pollution, and using a reusable set can help to reduce this problem. Many travel cutlery sets come with a fork, knife, spoon, and metal straw, making them a convenient and eco-friendly option for those who eat out often in Australia.</p>
<p>In addition to the environmental benefits, using reusable products can also help to save money in the long run in Australia. While the initial cost may be higher, these products are designed to be used over and over again, which can save you money in the long run. Plus, by using reusable products, you can help to reduce your overall consumption, which can lead to a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
<p>So next time you go to grab a disposable plastic straw or a sheet of parchment paper in Australia, consider opting for a reusable alternative instead. Every small change can make a big difference in the fight against plastic pollution and climate change in Australia.</p>
<p>As consumers, we have the power to make a positive impact on the environment by making conscious choices about the products we buy. By choosing reusable products, we can do our part to reduce waste and help create a more sustainable future for all in Australia. So don&#8217;t wait – start making the switch to reusable products today and join the movement towards a more sustainable tomorrow in Australia.

<p>Recycling is the process of collecting certain materials that would otherwise be thrown away as rubbish and turning them into something new. When people don&#8217;t recycle, that rubbish ends up in landfill or in our oceans when it could have become something new for someone else. Coming to this realisation, it&#8217;s important to understand why recycling is so important for our planet! With that in mind, we understand that starting your recycling journey may be quite confusing, what can be recycled? Do I have to wash my rubbish before throwing it? In this blog, we will go through tips to start your recycling journey the right way!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are The Benefits Of Recycling?</h2>



<p>One of the benefits which we have already mentioned is that the rubbish doesn&#8217;t end up in landfill and in our oceans. This also helps to conserve all the natural resources such as water, minerals and timber to name a few. Another benefit includes reducing pollution and greenhouse gases by decreasing the amount of new raw materials needed to make new things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can Be Recycled?</h2>



<p>So, you want to start recycling, you understand the benefits but you don&#8217;t know what can be recycled. That&#8217;s okay, we all start somewhere! There are many things that are 100% recyclable and can be thrown straight in the recycling bin but there are also some things that are not meant for recycling or are only partially recyclable, because of this, we have made a list of what is able to be recycled to help you!</p>



<p>All paper and cardboard are recyclable, this includes things like boxes (including pizza boxes if there are no leftovers in them), phone books, letters and envelopes, newspapers and old books or magazines. There are also some kitchen containers and some food packaging that can be recycled. Some of these include bottles and mason jars that are made from glass, food containers that are made from plastic, all water bottles and soft drink bottles that are made of plastic, all soft drink cans and other aluminium or steel cans and tins, juice bottles or milk cartons and even aerosol cans.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Upcycling?</h2>



<p>If you have some old things at home that you no longer need or want you can decide to recycle them by upcycling it! Upcycling is turning your old things into something that you can use for a new purpose. Some ideas could include making gardening pots out of plastic water bottles. All you need to do is cut it down to size and you have yourself a new gardening pot! Another awesome upcycle is making your tin cans into kitchen utensil holders or arts and crafts holders! There is an endless amount of possibilities that can come from upcycling and it reduces the impact on the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Live A More Sustainable Lifestyle</h2>



<p>By reducing your impact on the environment by recycling, you are taking one step closer towards a more sustainable lifestyle. Another great step would be to buy smarter by replacing your one-use items with reusable items in your household which creates less waste. If you are searching for more ways to help the environment, you can view our range of eco-friendly products that can help you live a more sustainable lifestyle <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/">here</a> or alternatively you can view our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ecoessentialsau" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FB</a> to get a better vision of what Pure Planet are about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Produce bags are a part of most people&#8217;s lives when they go to the grocery store. They are helpful in keeping certain fruits and vegetables together and are convenient when transporting your produce from the shop to your kitchen. However, they have been one of the major components to harm our environment and can also be harmful to our health as well. In this blog, we will discuss some of the main reasons why you need <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-produce-bags-5-pack/">reusable produce bags</a> in your life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Environment</h2>



<p>Of course, this is a very obvious point but still a very important one to make. The environment is impacted on a daily basis by many plastics around the world. Each time you take home plastic produce bags from the store, it is almost guaranteed to end up in either landfill or the ocean. By buying reusable bags, you are ensuring that plastic waste is reduced and think about it; if everybody switched to reusable bags that would reduce plastic pollution massively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Micro-Plastic</h2>



<p>Did you know that micro-plastic exists? Micro-plastic is produced from larger plastics which break into tiny particles because of photo-degradation and friction. Micro-plastic can leach into our food and into our digestive system. An interesting fact about micro-plastics is that once it is in our bodies, they can affect our health by damaging cells and causing inflammation in the body; this can also cause immune reactions in some cases. There have also been other health issues that have risen in recent decades from micro-plastics, yet researchers are still to do enough thorough research to confirm if this is caused by the micro-plastics. However, by using reusable bags, you are reducing your chances of micro-plastics entering the body!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Convenient</h2>



<p>So, we know that reusable bags are good for the environment and our health but another great thing about them is the convenience! Not only are they lightweight and easy to take anywhere with you but they can also hold 2kgs of produce per bag, most are made of breathable material for your produce which means that your produce will stay fresher for a longer period of time by preventing the air from becoming stagnant and they can be put in the washing machine to be cleaned or can be wiped down if needed. Another great thing about them is that they will last you years to even a lifetime if taken care of!</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that reusable produce bags are worth every dollar when you look at all the amazing benefits that come with them! If you would like to read more about or purchase the 5 pack of reusable produce bags, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-produce-bags-5-pack/">click here</a>. Alternatively, our cotton tote bag also has great benefits and can be found <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/">here</a>. </p>

<p id="14e41211-95e7-4dc6-ab37-c2d89497c939">In an effort to reduce plastic pollution, the New South Wales (NSW) government has announced a ban on single-use plastics. This is great news for the environment, and it&#8217;s something that we should all be getting behind. In this blog post, we will discuss what this means for NSW residents and businesses, what you need to know and how you can do your part to help reduce plastic pollution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the single-use plastics ban mean for my business?</h2>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">I know it can be convenient to buy cheap plastic takeaway cutlery, straws and bags for your customers and now you may be wondering what your business will do without them. The good news is that you can still do that but with non-plastic equivalents like paper straws and cutlery. This can also be an opportunity to encourage your customers to bring their own reusable utensils and bags for a percent off the purchase price or sell your own <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reusable straws</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cutlery sets</a> and <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">bags</a> to customers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the ban mean for individuals?</h2>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">Now is the perfect time to start thinking of reusable alternatives that are easy and convenient to take with you. Not only will that take the stress out of finding utensils and bags on the go, but it will also reduce the stress on the environment so it&#8217;s a win-win! Another great thing about having your reusable utensils with you at all times means it will cost you less in the long run, what&#8217;s not to love about saving money?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, what next?</h2>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">The NSW government&#8217;s ban on single-use plastics is a great step in the right direction but we all need to do our part to reduce plastic pollution. Here are some things you can do to help:</p>



<p id="197782c8-b108-49ff-b54f-86a7b509cdef">• Bring your own reusable bags, straws and utensils when you go out</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Avoid purchasing products with excessive packaging</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Recycle all the plastic you can</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">• Volunteer for or donate to organisations that are working to reduce plastic pollution</p>



<p id="e8cf8d8e-99b9-4f7c-b0da-b128df8d0172">We hope this blog post has given you some useful information about the NSW government&#8217;s ban on single-use plastics.

<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Plastic is polluting our planet and it&#8217;s time for all of us to do our part in reducing its impact. If you&#8217;re looking for ways to make your lifestyle more environmentally friendly, switching to a plastic-free lifestyle is a great place to start! In this blog post, we will discuss some tips for making the switch and how being environmentally friendly can benefit you and the planet. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Did you know that plastic not only takes up to 500 years to decompose but it also spreads toxins and is harming our wildlife? When you think of environmentally friendly what do you think of? We want to do our part in reducing the global warming which is affected by plastics and we want to help nature, wildlife and ourselves. Getting rid of unnecessary plastics in your home and workplace would be the best place to start.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking care of your health</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Many people don&#8217;t realise it, but studies have shown that plastics can actually leach chemicals into our food and drinks. This can have an effect on your health and can even cause issues with your immunity, can cause cancers and has even been linked to birth defects.</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Surprisingly, plastics have even been found in human waste and some types of foods and drinks that we consume. Unfortunately, our stomachs cannot break down plastics so this will in fact come out the other end and may cause health issues that can stay with us for a while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking care of wildlife</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Our wildlife suffers greatly from our plastic use which has caused a deadly effect on many creatures. Many of these creatures are a part of our sea life and can be caused by ingesting it or getting tangled in it. The worst part is that it isn&#8217;t surprising as there are currently roughly 51 trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans. If everyone could have a plastic-free lifestyle, our marine life and oceans may eventually get healthier but for now, we need to all do our part in encouraging others to help save our oceans.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Switching to a plastic-free lifestyle</h2>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So you may be thinking &#8220;yes, I want to help my health and our wildlife but how?&#8221;, well firstly you could switch out your usual plastic products! There are now many reusable alternatives you could buy to replace your everyday plastic items and most of the time it ends up being cheaper than buying plastics repeatedly. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the products;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Straws</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Straws have such a big impact on our environment and are one of the main products found in our waterways. There are now so many different alternatives to plastic straws so it&#8217;s safe to say that everyone has a choice on which one they would prefer. Here are a few options now available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Retractable metal straws</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-black/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">metal straws</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-blue/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Silicone Straws</a></li><li>Paper straws</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cutlery</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So, you&#8217;re on the road and maybe getting takeaway for lunch, the takeaway comes with plastic cutlery and eventually ends up in the landfill. Not the best situation but luckily we are taking steps to change it. Again there are different alternatives to plastic cutlery so we don&#8217;t have to add to the environmental impacts of plastics anymore! Here are a few options available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/eco-friendly-travel-cutlery-set/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Travel Cutlery Set</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/cutlery-travel-pouch/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cutlery travel pouch</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pegs</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Plastic pegs are history with the new options available to replace them! We don&#8217;t need another thing added to our landfill and we don&#8217;t need to keep running down the road because our pegs keep breaking either. Here are a few options available;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metal pegs</a></li><li>Timber pegs</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Self-care</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Make-up wipes and earbuds are other products that make their way into our oceans and landfill. It not only impacts our environment but they can both be harsh on our skin too. Some options available include;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-makeup-remover-pads/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reusable make-up remover pads</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reusable earbuds</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen products</h3>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">We need to bake, we get out baking paper. We need to put food away, we get out cling wrap. We go shopping, we get out our plastic bags. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t think about these products and how they can also have an impact on the environment. There are some alternatives to these products with more eco-friendly products coming out to replace these every day! Some of the alternative choices available include;</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://non-stick%20baking%20mat/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Non-stick Baking mat</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tote bag</a></li><li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-silicone-food-covers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Silicone food covers</a></li><li>produce bags</li></ul>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">Some big changes are coming in NSW with the government banning single-use plastics in June to phase out all single-use plastics by November 2022. This is exciting news for all the people that would like to help reduce our impact on the environment but let&#8217;s take it one step further by replacing all single-use items that we can with reusable products instead to reduce our overall waste.</p>



<p id="4797beea-1100-46d8-9f23-eae4fe1515e2">So you have some options to get you started on your plastic-free lifestyle. What steps are you going to start taking to take better care of yourself and your environment?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that plastic straws are bad for the environment. Every year, millions of plastic straws end up in our oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems. But what many people don&#8217;t know is that there are easy alternatives to plastic straws &#8211; reusable straws! Reusable straws made of metal or silicone can be used over and over again, and they help reduce the amount of plastic waste we produce each year. If every person made the switch to reusable straws, we could make a huge impact on preserving our oceans and planet.</p>
<h2>How do Plastic Straws Impact the Environment?</h2>
<p>Plastic pollution in the environment is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. It has been estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish. There are many factors contributing to this problem, but one of the main ones is plastic straws.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will share with you some helpful tips and tricks on how to reduce your plastic waste and make the transition easier.</p>
<h2>What Role Do We Play in This?</h2>
<p>As the world’s population continues to grow, the amount of plastic waste is also growing. We are seeing more and more plastic recycling efforts to reduce the impact on our environment.</p>
<p>The first step in reducing the impact of plastic is to recycle it. This helps keep it out of landfills and oceans. The next step would be to use <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-orange/">reusable straws</a> instead of disposable ones.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits to reusable straws?</h2>
<p>There are many benefits to using reusable straws:</p>
<p>&#8211; They help reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>&#8211; They&#8217;re better for the environment.</p>
<p>&#8211; They can last for years if taken care of properly.</p>
<p>&#8211; You can choose from a variety of materials, including metal and silicone.</p>
<p>&#8211; They come in a variety of colours and styles</p>
<p>&#8211; They&#8217;re easy to clean.</p>
<h2>How Can I Make the Switch?</h2>
<p>Making the switch from disposable plastic straws to reusable straws can be a little daunting, but it&#8217;s not as hard as you might think. Here are some tips on how to make the transition easier:</p>
<p>&#8211; Start by gradually replacing plastic straws with reusable ones. This will help you get used to using them and make the transition easier.</p>
<p>&#8211; Choose a style of <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/silver-retractable-metal-straw/">reusable straw</a> that suits your needs. There are many different types of <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-pink/">reusable straws</a> available, so find one that works best for you.</p>
<p>&#8211; Keep a few <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/gold-retractable-metal-straw/">reusable straws</a> in your bag or car so you always have them when you need them.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you&#8217;re at a restaurant or café, ask for your drink without a straw. Most places will be happy to accommodate you.</p>
<h2>What Are Some Alternatives to Plastic Straws?</h2>
<p>Plastic straws are one of the most common items found in the ocean. They are not biodegradable and can be harmful to marine life. So, what are some alternatives?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper straws</strong> are an environmentally friendly option that is both biodegradable and recyclable however they are typically a one-use item as they go soggy once used.</li>
<li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-black/"><strong><em>M</em>etal straws</strong></a> are a great alternative as they last years and are easy to clean. They are an eco-friendly alternative to disposable plastic straws that offer a little bit more convenience than paper or silicone options. Pure Planet range of <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-silver/">metal straws</a> allows you to enjoy your beverages any time without the nasty environmental impact. Eliminate unnecessary waste by switching to materials that are kinder to the environment and can be reused, rather than disposed of after one use. Switching to reusable materials instead of single-use will help keep our planet happy.</li>
<li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-blue/"><strong>Silicone straws</strong></a> are great because they’ll easily slide seamlessly through all types of drinks, and their jumbo size makes them perfect for milkshakes, thick shakes, frappes, bubble tea and smoothies. Made from medical-grade silicone, so they’re food-safe and environmentally friendly, as you can simply pop them in the dishwasher and use them again! These <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/jumbo-silicone-straws-green/">silicone straws</a> can also be used in warm drinks, as they won’t melt, break or retain the heat like metal straws.</li>
<li><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/black-retractable-metal-straws/"><strong>Retractable metal straws </strong></a>are great because they are compact and can be taken anywhere, the collapsible design means it’s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it.

</ul>
<p>plastic straws are harming the environment and using reusable plastic straws can do a lot of good. At first, it may seem like plastic straws are harmless because they&#8217;re used for such an insignificant amount of time before we throw them away — but that&#8217;s not necessarily true. After reading this article, you now know how plastic is harmful to the ocean ecosystem and how even small things like plastic straw use contributes to pollution on land as well.

<p><strong>Zero Waste is an ethical lifestyle that is focused on reducing the amount of waste that one produces. There are many reasons why people live this way, but they all revolve around the idea of living in harmony with nature and reducing our impact on the environment for future generations. </strong>We are not only living in a time of climate change but are also producing more waste than ever before. So what can you do to minimize your environmental footprint?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start Small</strong></h2>



<p>It is unrealistic to expect to start living a zero-waste lifestyle overnight. It takes time to adapt to a new way of living, so go easy on yourself while you get used to a new way of doing things. One way to get started is to purchase reusable products where possible, like <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/tote-bag/">reusable shopping bags</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-facial-pads-white/" data-type="product" data-id="2141">makeup pads</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/reusable-earbuds/">earbuds</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">pegs</a>, <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/non-stick-baking-mat/">baking mats</a> or <a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-straws-gold/" data-type="product" data-id="2134">straws</a>, for example. When possible, choose in-store items over items that have been delivered in plastic wrap or Styrofoam packaging. If you find yourself with leftovers from a meal, try to avoid using disposable utensils and containers for storing leftovers instead of using reusable containers. And lastly, try to reduce the number of plastics you use on a daily basis by buying food items that come in paper or cardboard packaging or even bring your own containers when shopping.</p>



<p>It is possible to live a zero-waste life, (well very close to zero). But it is impossible to live a zero-waste lifestyle without changing your way of thinking. In order to have a zero-waste lifestyle, you need to change some of the habits that have been instilled in you since childhood. It’s not an easy task but it can be done with some effort. Not every person will be able to adopt this lifestyle at first; it takes patience and determination.</p>



<p>The first major change that needs to happen is being able to differentiate between needs and wants. Do you need that new shirt, or do you just want it? The second major change that needs to happen is changing how you shop. You can shop for fresh produce at your local grocery store, purchase clothing at thrift stores instead of buying new clothes, or buy some high-quality items once and use them for years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Can I Reduce My Household Waste?</strong></h2>



<p>To start living a zero-waste lifestyle, the first thing you need to do is take an inventory of what&#8217;s in your trash can. If it&#8217;s mostly food scraps and paper products, then the next step would be to consider composting your food and paper waste. Composting is a natural process where microorganisms decompose organic matter and turn it into compost. It can be done at home using a compost bin or by spreading grass clippings and vegetable waste on your garden soil.</p>



<p>Composting is beneficial for the environment and does not contribute to greenhouse gases as it can help produce methane gas that has 25 times more capacity than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. This means that it traps more heat than carbon dioxide does, making it less detrimental to the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can I Avoid Fashion and Textile Waste?</h2>



<p>Another simple way to reduce waste is to consider shopping at second hand and thrift stores for clothes and other household items. These stores offer great deals and keep your dollars local, while also reducing the amount of waste in the environment. The average person throws away over 70 pounds of clothes each year. When we dispose of clothing, we are throwing away resources and money as well as adding to the world’s waste problem.</p>



<p>There are many ways you can reduce the amount of clothes that you throw away every year. One way is to take a closer look at what you already have in your closet before going out and buying something new. You may just find that what you have is perfect for the occasion or event! In addition to reducing waste, this strategy will also help save money!</p>



<p>Another way to reduce waste is by donating your used clothing instead of throwing them out. There are so many people who could use your old clothes for job interviews, special occasions etc.</p>



<p>While it is almost impossible to live a zero-waste life, there are ways that you can reduce the amount of waste you produce. The saying &#8220;reduce, reuse, recycle&#8221; is important when thinking about living a zero-waste life. Reducing the amount of waste you produce is one of the most effective ways to reduce your footprint. This can be done by shopping for items that are durable and reusable, stopping buying things that create unnecessary packaging, and choosing products with less toxic chemicals.</p>



<p>There are many ways to reduce your impact on the earth. By <strong>simply following some of our tips</strong>, you’ll be on track to living<strong> a more waste-free</strong> life with your family and friends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that plastic is one of the worst things for our environment. It is made from toxic chemicals, it can&#8217;t be recycled, and it ends up in landfill or our oceans where animals are consuming it. Over the last few years, there has been a shift in attitude towards plastic and its environmental impact. <strong>Consumers have become more conscious of the impact we are having.</strong></p>
<p>This is evident through the <strong>2017 phase-out of plastic bags</strong> across Australia, and the <strong>introduction of paper straws</strong> across many restaurants, cafes and even fast-food chains like McDonald&#8217;s. Many states are now taking steps to <strong>completely ban single-use plastics</strong> such as plastic cutlery and plastic straws. We are heading in the right direction, however, the need to constantly revaluate our waste habits has never been more important!</p>
<h2>Plastic pegs are cheap and Designed to Break!</h2>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about <strong>a simple, household item</strong> that can be <strong>swapped out to reduce your environmental impact</strong>. <strong>Plastic pegs are a staple</strong> of every household, yet they are so bad for the environment. Plastic pegs <strong>are convenient and cheap</strong>, you can buy them from your local supermarket, and they do a pretty good job at keeping our clothes on the line. But let&#8217;s face it, they are priced low because <strong>they just don&#8217;t last</strong>, and they weren&#8217;t made too!</p>
<p><strong>Plastic pegs are fragile and easily breakable</strong>. They<strong> can&#8217;t withstand the outdoors,</strong> and so after a few weeks of use, they begin to <strong>fade, crack, rust and break</strong>. Sending you back to the supermarket to purchase another set. <strong>It&#8217;s a never-ending cycle and their cheap price point starts to add up.</strong></p>
<p>Plastic pegs have an impact on more than just your wallet. Every time you throw them away, <strong>they are sent straight into landfills where they sit for hundreds of years</strong>, slowly breaking down and <strong>leaking toxic chemicals</strong> into our waterways and soil.</p>
<h2>Make the switch to stainless steel metal pegs</h2>
<p>So, what can you do to stop this cycle? The next time you find yourself needing to buy new pegs, opt to <strong>invest in some metal ones</strong>! They may be <strong>more expensive upfront</strong>, but they will outlive your old plastic pegs and <strong>last you a lifetime</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">Metal Pegs</a> are <strong>the perfect alternative</strong> to plastic pegs. Made from <strong>marine grade 316 stainless steel</strong>, these pegs are built to last. They are<strong> the strongest and most durable clothespins available on the market</strong>. These pegs <strong>won&#8217;t become flimsy, rust or corrode over time</strong> like their plastic alternative.</p>
<p>These clothespins are so good, <strong>you&#8217;ll be using them forever</strong>! Simply set yourself up with one or two sets and you&#8217;ll never have to buy another clothespin again! They&#8217;re constructed using one solid, springless piece of metal, which makes them <strong>more durable and dependable than plastic, wood, or bamboo</strong>. These other types of pegs have a tendency to twist or break apart under pressure.</p>
<p><a href="https://ecoessentials.com.au/metal-pegs/">Metal pegs</a> are not only a convenient alternative to plastic ones, they are <strong>the new and improved version of traditional pegs</strong>. Whether you <strong>leave your pegs on the line or keep them indoors</strong>, these pegs are <strong>guaranteed to last</strong> you a lifetime!
