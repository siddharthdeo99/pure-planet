<p>A more sustainable lifestyle can benefit both people and the planet alike. It’s never too late to make some changes in order to live greener. In fact, making even little tweaks here or there can be enough to start living sustainably without much effort at all!</p>
<p>The first step is finding out what works best for you and your family. The more you recycle and reuse things in your daily life, the less waste is generated. Just a few simple swaps could make a big difference! The good news is that it doesn’t take much to make eco-friendly changes in everyday life!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pure Planet&#8217; Forever Metal Pegs 30 pack are totally sustainable and built to last. Just one purchase of our newest line of clothespins will spare 240 sets of plastic pegs from the landfill, that&#8217;s close to a billion individual pieces!</p>
<p>Eco-friendly designs that won’t let you down. Our Marine Grade 316 Stainless Steel Metal Pegs 30 pack are perfect for earth-conscious consumers looking for a product that is high quality, looks great and is built to last.</p>
<p>Our metal pegs 30 pack are the strongest and most durable clothespin available on the market. They won&#8217;t become flimsy, rust or corrode over time like plastic. That&#8217;s why we are confident enough to offer a lifetime guarantee, so you&#8217;ll never have to buy another one!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why supermarkets don&#8217;t sell metal pegs? It is because they last too long. Plastic pegs need to be replaced constantly and they want you to go in there every month or so and buy a new packet of shiny and brightly coloured plastic pegs.</p>
<p>So, you have to ask yourself which is better? A packet of plastic pegs will last you a couple of months before becoming flimsy and eventually breaking and ending up in landfill, where they live for hundreds of years, polluting and adding toxins to the environment.</p>
<p>Investing in a pack of our stainless steel pegs will last you for years. They are strong and durable and every person who invests in them is sparing the planet from millions of plastic pegs. It&#8217;s a no-brainer really!</p>
<p>Our metal pegs 30 pack are perfect for eco-friendly enthusiasts who need high-quality products that look great, too! Pure Planet works hard to make sure every item we stock has a positive effect on the environment and our stainless steel pegs do just that!</p>
<p>Made with marine-grade 316 stainless steel, these pegs will last you a lifetime. No matter where you live or how you store them, these pegs won&#8217;t rust or corrode. Even better, you can trust they won&#8217;t melt, fade or retain heat when left out in the sun all day!</p>
<p>The main advantage of our metal pegs 30 pack is that they are better for the environment. They don&#8217;t break easily even after years of use. They are also stronger, which means they can hold more clothes on the line without them snapping in half!</p>
<p>Our metal pegs come in two different size options &#8211; a pack of 30 or 60 pegs, each arriving in their own reusable drawstring bag for easy storage. Metal pegs make for a more environmentally friendly choice than plastic ones as they last much longer and thus require fewer materials to produce.</p>
<p>As more people start making these types of environmental decisions, we will all be on track to living in a greener world.</p>
<h2>Features of our Metal Pegs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Significantly reduce the number of plastic pegs that end up in landfill.</li>
<li>Industrial Strength Metal Pegs that will hold up to any task.</li>
<li>Eco-friendly and long-lasting design for the earth-conscious consumer.</li>
<li>Does not break or bend like plastic pegs.</li>
<li>Rust-resistant, these pegs will withstand the harshest Australian conditions.</li>
<li>Quality materials ensure they last forever</li>
<li>Packaged in their own reusable drawstring bag for convenient storage.</li>
</ul>
