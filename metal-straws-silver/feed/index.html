					<description><![CDATA[These straws have been better than expected. I was worried they would be hard to clean up but they have been so easy to clean up and no problems with them at all. I love having reusable straws in my home too. I definitely would recommend them to anyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow these metal straws are so good! I have found them so easy to use and to clean up and I love having them in my home. The kids have asked me to buy more so they don&#039;t need to take turns in using them so looks like I will be purchasing more very soon! I highly recommend!]]></description>
