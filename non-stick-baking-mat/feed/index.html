					<description><![CDATA[I am very happy with my purchase! I mainly bought the non-stick baking mat to try and get rid of more single-use things in my home but I have no idea why I didn&#039;t buy one sooner! They are so easy to use and to clean up and so convenient! I have made so many things on it already and I haven&#039;t had any issues with things sticking to it like I have previously with baking paper! I would definitely recommend!]]></description>
