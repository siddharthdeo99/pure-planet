<h4>Silver Retractable Metal Straw</h4>
<p>Retractable metal straw is a new and innovative product that is perfect for both kids and adults. They are made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground!</p>
<p>In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what’s not to love?! This collapsible design means it’s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it.</p>
<p>Cleaning couldn’t be easier, either: just unscrew to separate the brush while still attached to the straw! That double cleaning action makes for cleaner drinking – you don’t need all those germs in your mouth after all!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pure Planet' Metal Pegs are totally sustainable and built to last. Just one purchase of our newest line of clothespins will spare 240 sets of plastic pegs from the landfill, that's close to a billion individual pieces!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pure Planet&#8217; Forever Metal Pegs 30 pack are totally sustainable and built to last. Just one purchase of our newest line of clothespins will spare 240 sets of plastic pegs from the landfill, that&#8217;s close to a billion individual pieces!</p>
<p>Eco-friendly designs that won’t let you down. Our Marine Grade 316 Stainless Steel Metal Pegs 30 pack are perfect for earth-conscious consumers looking for a product that is high quality, looks great and is built to last.</p>
<p>Our metal pegs 30 pack are the strongest and most durable clothespin available on the market. They won&#8217;t become flimsy, rust or corrode over time like plastic. That&#8217;s why we are confident enough to offer a lifetime guarantee, so you&#8217;ll never have to buy another one!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why supermarkets don&#8217;t sell metal pegs? It is because they last too long. Plastic pegs need to be replaced constantly and they want you to go in there every month or so and buy a new packet of shiny and brightly coloured plastic pegs.</p>
<p>So, you have to ask yourself which is better? A packet of plastic pegs will last you a couple of months before becoming flimsy and eventually breaking and ending up in landfill, where they live for hundreds of years, polluting and adding toxins to the environment.</p>
<p>Investing in a pack of our stainless steel pegs will last you for years. They are strong and durable and every person who invests in them is sparing the planet from millions of plastic pegs. It&#8217;s a no-brainer really!</p>
<p>Our metal pegs 30 pack are perfect for eco-friendly enthusiasts who need high-quality products that look great, too! Pure Planet works hard to make sure every item we stock has a positive effect on the environment and our stainless steel pegs do just that!</p>
<p>Made with marine-grade 316 stainless steel, these pegs will last you a lifetime. No matter where you live or how you store them, these pegs won&#8217;t rust or corrode. Even better, you can trust they won&#8217;t melt, fade or retain heat when left out in the sun all day!</p>
<p>The main advantage of our metal pegs 30 pack is that they are better for the environment. They don&#8217;t break easily even after years of use. They are also stronger, which means they can hold more clothes on the line without them snapping in half!</p>
<p>Our metal pegs come in two different size options &#8211; a pack of 30 or 60 pegs, each arriving in their own reusable drawstring bag for easy storage. Metal pegs make for a more environmentally friendly choice than plastic ones as they last much longer and thus require fewer materials to produce.</p>
<p>As more people start making these types of environmental decisions, we will all be on track to living in a greener world.</p>
<h2>Features of our Metal Pegs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Significantly reduce the number of plastic pegs that end up in landfill.</li>
