										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The silver retractable metal straw is here. What was once a bulky, clunky metal straw is now light and portable! This collapsible design means it&#8217;s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it. Cleaning couldn&#8217;t be easier, either: just unscrew to separate then brush while still attached to the straw! That double cleaning action makes for cleaner drinking &#8211; you don&#8217;t need all those germs in your mouth after all!</p>
<p>When you look at the list of things that are polluting our planet, it is easy to see how important it is for people to start making some small changes. One way many people are taking a stand is by using retractable metal straws. We love how metal straws never go soft or soggy like paper straws! They hold their shape and last for years, even decades, without breaking or becoming rusted. You can enjoy your drinks without any worry or guilt of using a product that will end up in the landfill or ocean eventually!</p>
<p>Retractable metal straw is a new and innovative product that is perfect for both kids and adults. They are made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground! Retractable Metal Straws also have the added benefit of being environmentally friendly because no trees are cut down to make them, like the new paper straws you might have seen at restaurants recently. In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what&#8217;s not to love?!</p>
<p>Metal straws are safe for children of all ages as well as adults who have braces or dental work, and those with sensitive teeth that may be prone to tooth decay from prolonged use of plastic straws.</p>

<p>When you look at the list of things that are polluting our planet, it is easy to see how important it is for people to start making some small changes. One way many people are taking a stand is by using retractable metal straws.</p>
<p>We love how metal straws never go soft or soggy like paper straws! They hold their shape and last for years, even decades, without breaking or becoming rusted. You can enjoy your drinks without any worry or guilt of using a product that will end up in the landfill or ocean eventually!</p>
<p>Gold retractable metal straw is a new and innovative product that is perfect for both kids and adults. Theyare made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground!</p>
<p>Retractable Metal Straws also have the added benefit of being environmentally friendly because no trees are cut down to make them, like the new paper straws you might have seen at restaurants recently. In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what&#8217;s not to love?!</p>
<p>Metal straws are safe for children of all ages as well as adults who have braces or dental work, and those with sensitive teeth that may be prone to tooth decay from prolonged use of plastic straws.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The newest addition to our line of sustainable accessories, the Eco friendly travel cutlery set that comes with a carrying container. For those who want to be ready for anything! Order yours today!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the Eco-Friendly Travel Cutlery Set is the perfect thing you need if you like to eat out, need cutlery for work or are constantly on the road. Eating out these days is tough on the environment. Unfortunately, with plastic utensils, straws and fast food packaging it can be hard to enjoy it without having a negative effect on our environment.</p>
<p>Here at Pure Planet, we&#8217;ve found the perfect solution to this problem. Meet our newest eco-friendly accessory &#8211; the stainless steel eco-friendly travel cutlery set with a carrying container!</p>
<p>Our eco-friendly travel cutlery set is lightweight in design and has an environmentally friendly construction making it easy to take with you wherever your travels might lead.</p>
<p>Ever find yourself out and about getting your lunch and your only option is plastic cutlery to go with your meal? Not ideal right? Or maybe you&#8217;re travelling and want a way to be ready for anything like when you order food and there are no other options than to eat with your hands?</p>
<p>Well, no more! Our eco-friendly travel cutlery set has you covered! This kit comes complete with a knife, fork, spoon and metal straw all packed neatly into its own carrying case, so just pop it in your bag, backpack or briefcase before heading out and you&#8217;ll always be ready for whatever situation arises.</p>
<p>The best part? When you&#8217;re done, you can put them back in the container and store them until your next adventure.</p>
<p>This Eco-Friendly Travel Cutlery Set is made of stainless steel, making it perfect for any person who wants to be more eco-friendly and who needs to eat on the road.</p>
<p>No more random cutlery floating around your bag or having to rummage around in the office kitchen looking for a clean fork!</p>
<p>No more trying to cut meat with a flimsy plastic knife or trying to pick up fruit or veggies with a fork that has no strength whatsoever, this set has you covered! With a handy carry container, this set is compact enough for easy storage, so you&#8217;ll never lose your cutlery and it won&#8217;t take up heaps of space in your bag.</p>
<p>The included fork and knife are perfect for even your most delicate dishes but tough enough for that steak you were craving all day. And if the need arises, there is also a spoon and straw included for your convenience.</p>
<p>With this compact set, you&#8217;ll never be unprepared again when it comes time to eat outside or on the go. So no more excuses not to enjoy outdoor dining without using single-use plastics again.</p>
<h2>Why the Eco-Friendly Travel Cutlery Set</h2>
<p>Durable stainless steel construction means no more plastic utensils! This cutlery set will last you forever.</p>
<p>The edges are smooth for a more enjoyable dining experience, unlike the sharp edges of plastic cutlery, especially plastic forks. Which isn&#8217;t ideal, especially if you are feeding young children.</p>
<p>These utensils not only look good but also reduce the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/carrying-your-own-fork-spoon-help-plastic-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volume of plastic</a> that would be used or thrown away with traditional disposable items. The stainless steel is 100% cruelty-free. It would make a perfect gift for anyone that travels or someone who always takes their lunch to work but dislikes single-use cutlery!</p>
<p>The set is also easy to clean and dishwasher-safe. It&#8217;s lightweight so it doesn&#8217;t weigh down your luggage, backpack or briefcase &#8211; perfect for the eco-conscious traveller. The carrying container can be reused as well! If you&#8217;re looking for a great alternative to plastic throw-away items, you&#8217;ve found it!</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All neatly organised in a durable and reusable carry container.</li>
<li>Say goodbye to harmful plastic cutlery, this set is the perfect alternative.</li>
<li>High-quality stainless steel utensils are lightweight, so they won&#8217;t weigh you down when you&#8217;re out and about.</li>
<li>Easy to Clean: these utensils can be washed by hand or simply pop them in the dishwasher.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go ahead and enjoy that next meal, guilt-free! Try out our Eco-Friendly Travel Cutlery Set today!</p>

Just a few simple swaps could make a big difference! The good news is that it doesn’t take much to make eco-friendly changes in everyday life!</p>
