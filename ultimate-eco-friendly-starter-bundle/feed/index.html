					<description><![CDATA[I purchased the starter bundle and I have got to say I am impressed at the quality of these items! I knew I would love my metal pegs and tote bag because I have used similar items before but I didn&#039;t know hot the baking mat or metal straw would be like. It&#039;s safe to say I love all of the items! The baking mat is fantastic; I am loving how nothing sticks to it and it makes it so easy for things like cookies in the oven and the metal straws are great, they are so easy to clean and are so convenient to have! I would definitely recommend this bundle to everyone! ]]></description>
