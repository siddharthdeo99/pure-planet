It is made from toxic chemicals, it can&#8217;t be recycled, and it ends up in landfill or our oceans where animals are consuming it. Over the last few years, there has been a shift in attitude towards plastic and its environmental impact. <strong>Consumers have become more conscious of the impact we are having.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is evident through the <strong>2017 phase-out of plastic bags<\/strong> across Australia, and the <strong>introduction of paper straws<\/strong> across many restaurants, cafes and even fast-food chains like McDonald&#8217;s. Many states are now taking steps to <strong>completely ban single-use plastics<\/strong> such as plastic cutlery and plastic straws. We are heading in the right direction, however, the need to constantly revaluate our waste habits has never been more important!<\/p>\n<h2>Plastic pegs are cheap and Designed to Break!<\/h2>\n<p>Today, we are going to talk about <strong>a simple, household item<\/strong> that can be <strong>swapped out to reduce your environmental impact<\/strong>. <strong>Plastic pegs are a staple<\/strong> of every household, yet they are so bad for the environment. Plastic pegs <strong>are convenient and cheap<\/strong>, you can buy them from your local supermarket, and they do a pretty good job at keeping our clothes on the line. But let&#8217;s face it, they are priced low because <strong>they just don&#8217;t last<\/strong>, and they weren&#8217;t made too!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plastic pegs are fragile and easily breakable<\/strong>. They<strong> can&#8217;t withstand the outdoors,<\/strong> and so after a few weeks of use, they begin to <strong>fade, crack, rust and break<\/strong>. Sending you back to the supermarket to purchase another set. <strong>It&#8217;s a never-ending cycle and their cheap price point starts to add up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Plastic pegs have an impact on more than just your wallet. Every time you throw them away, <strong>they are sent straight into landfills where they sit for hundreds of years<\/strong>, slowly breaking down and <strong>leaking toxic chemicals<\/strong> into our waterways and soil.<\/p>\n<h2>Make the switch to stainless steel metal pegs<\/h2>\n<p>So, what can you do to stop this cycle? The next time you find yourself needing to buy new pegs, opt to <strong>invest in some metal ones<\/strong>! They may be <strong>more expensive upfront<\/strong>, but they will outlive your old plastic pegs and <strong>last you a lifetime<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/metal-pegs\/\">Metal Pegs<\/a> are <strong>the perfect alternative<\/strong> to plastic pegs. Made from <strong>marine grade 316 stainless steel<\/strong>, these pegs are built to last. They are<strong> the strongest and most durable clothespins available on the market<\/strong>.

Simply set yourself up with one or two sets and you&#8217;ll never have to buy another clothespin again! They&#8217;re constructed using one solid, springless piece of metal, which makes them <strong>more durable and dependable than plastic, wood, or bamboo<\/strong>.
