Maybe you don&#8217;t know if they are right for you or what the benefits are! These are our top 4 reasons why you should make the switch to reusable earbuds today!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-they-re-better-for-the-environment\">1. They&#8217;re better for the environment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One pair of reusable earbuds can keep billions of disposable earbuds from ending up in landfills. Reusable earbuds can last up to three years, while traditional cotton swabs are only meant to be used once. Because they have a longer lifespan, they create less waste and help the environment in the long run. It is estimated that around the world we use 1.5 billion single-use earbuds every day which are not recycled and end up in our rivers and oceans! Once this occurs, the marine life in our waters can ingest it and can cause serious issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-they-re-more-sanitary\">2. They&#8217;re more sanitary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Silicone is a non-porous material, which means that bacteria and other contaminants cannot penetrate it and cause infection. In contrast, cotton is a porous material that can easily harbour bacteria. Silicone is also easy to clean and can be disinfected with soap and water or alcohol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-they-re-more-comfortable\">3. They&#8217;re more comfortable<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most reusable earbuds are made from soft silicone, which is much more comfortable than the hard plastic used in disposable earbuds.&nbsp; Silicone is also more flexible, so reusable earbuds can be adjusted to fit the shape of your ear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable silicone earbuds are also good for your ears because they don&#8217;t absorb water from inside the ear canal. When you use cotton swabs, you may accidentally push wax and other contaminants further into your ears. This can cause irritation and even infection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-they-last-longer\">4. They last longer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A good set of reusable earbuds can last for years if properly cared for. This means that you&#8217;ll end up wasting money if you keep buying disposable earbuds every month. One set of earbuds can replace 1000 single-use earbuds!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making the switch to <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/reusable-earbuds\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"product\" data-id=\"852\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reusable earbuds<\/a> is a great way to help the environment and your ears.
