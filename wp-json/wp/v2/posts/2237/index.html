It can also be a very environmentally friendly holiday if you know how to do it right! In this blog post, we will give you some tips on how to have an eco-friendly easter. From using recycled eggs to picking up after your pet, we have you covered! Let&#8217;s make this easter the greenest one yet!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So how can we make Easter eco-friendly?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One big step we can take is by ditching the plastic eggs and using eggs made of wood or paper instead. The wooden ones are great to reuse and will last many years if taken care of too which is a bonus! If you&#8217;re looking for a biodegradable option, go for the paper eggs. These can be composted after use and will break down within weeks. If you think you need to give up dying your eggs to be eco-friendly don&#8217;t worry, you can easily make your own natural food colouring too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the kids like having an easter egg basket for their easter egg hunt be sure to look for second-hand baskets before buying a new one or try to make your own! Many easter egg baskets end up in the bin at the end of the day and add to the growing amount of rubbish in our landfills. Making your own could be a great activity to do with the kids and will help the environment along the way! Another good alternative would be to skip the individually wrapped sweets altogether if possible! Get creative and think outside the box; there are many awesome things you can do instead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Easter egg hunts; another way to make easter eco-friendly is by picking up after your pet. This one may seem like common sense but many people forget to do it! Make sure to bring bags with you on your Easter egg hunt and pick up any messes your furry friend makes. This will help keep our parks and nature trails clean!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like to decorate your home for Easter? This can be a fun activity you do every Easter however a lot of the time the decorations are ones that many buy for a one-use thing. A great way to make this tradition eco-friendly is by buying good quality easter decorations that you can re-use every year. This way you can continue enjoying these moments the eco-friendly way (it can also save you money)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to help the environment out this Easter would be to do eco-friendly arts and crafts instead! There are many awesome activities that you can do and we are sure the kids would love them too! You can make yummy treats in the kitchen with mum and dad, make dried flower eggs or even make flat origami easter cards for the family!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few of our eco-friendly Easter suggestions! We hope you have a great easter and remember to try out some of these tips this Easter!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more ways to make your home more eco-friendly, check out our other blogs <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/blog\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Easter is a time when many people celebrate with family and friends.
