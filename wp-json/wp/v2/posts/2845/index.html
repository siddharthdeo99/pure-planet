Taking small everyday steps can make a big impact! People often feel like they don&#8217;t have enough time or resources to help the environment but this simply isn&#8217;t the case. In this blog, we will go through some of the steps you can make each day to do your part in helping the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recycling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recycling is one of the easiest things you can do that can make such a big impact! When we recycle, we are limiting the amount of rubbish that goes into landfill while also providing materials to remake other things for someone else. The easiest way to remind yourself to recycle is to have a recycling bin at home. most things that are recyclable will have the logo on them so you can rest assured that you are recycling the right materials. The best part is, recycling has more than one benefit! Did you know that recycling can also help save energy? That&#8217;s right! When recycling properly, it can save energy because the process to recycle materials like aluminium uses roughly 95% less energy than if it were manufactured. Materials like metals can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by roughly 50% when recycled, and recycling plastic reduces the amount of petroleum used by around 80% which means it is also reducing fossil fuels. It&#8217;s easy to see why recycling is the biggest small everyday step you can make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Donate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself booking a council clean-up or wanting to take things to the tip see if you can donate it first. There are many people who would find it useful or could do something with it. Some people like to upstyle old furniture while others are in need and would be very appreciative to receive these items. Some items could include clothes, furniture, toys and home appliances, however, you could almost donate anything! Other places that you could donate to are hospitals, refugees and homeless shelters. When you are donating your belongings instead of throwing them out, you are decreasing the amount of waste that becomes landfill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Better Purchase Choices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time when people buy new home appliances they don&#8217;t think of anything else but how the appliance works. However, another thing people should be looking for is the energy star rating. A higher energy star rating means you won&#8217;t be using as much energy which also helps protect the environment. If you can get a second-hand appliance, it would be beneficial as that would create less waste than if you were to buy brand new. Other smart purchase choices you can make include things that can eventually be recycled or <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/shop\/\">reusable products<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buy Locally Grown Products<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that can be done is to buy your products\/produce locally! Not only will this reduce your carbon footprint but it will also be supporting local farmers and businesses. If you want to go one step further, you can even attempt to grow your own produce which means you know what&#8217;s going into the soil, you know the value of your products and you know that they won&#8217;t be sprayed with any nasties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Help The Environment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While these may seem like some small steps, they can make a big difference long term.
