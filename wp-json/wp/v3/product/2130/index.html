What was once a bulky, clunky metal straw is now light and portable! This collapsible design means it&#8217;s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it.<\/p>\n<p>Cleaning couldn&#8217;t be easier, either: just unscrew to separate the brush while still attached to the straw! That double cleaning action makes for cleaner drinking &#8211; you don&#8217;t need all those germs in your mouth after all!<\/p>\n<p>When you look at the list of things that are polluting our planet, it is easy to see how important it is for people to start making some small changes. One way many people are taking a stand is by using retractable metal straws.<\/p>\n<p>We love how metal straws never go soft or soggy like paper straws! They hold their shape and last for years, even decades, without breaking or becoming rusted. You can enjoy your drinks without any worry or guilt of using a product that will end up in the landfill or ocean eventually!<\/p>\n<p>Gold retractable metal straw is a new and innovative product that is perfect for both kids and adults. Theyare made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground!<\/p>\n<p>Retractable Metal Straws also have the added benefit of being environmentally friendly because no trees are cut down to make them, like the new paper straws you might have seen at restaurants recently. In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what&#8217;s not to love?!<\/p>\n<p>Metal straws are safe for children of all ages as well as adults who have braces or dental work, and those with sensitive teeth that may be prone to tooth decay from prolonged use of plastic straws.<\/p>\n<h4>\u00a0About Our Gold Retractable Metal Straw<\/h4>\n<p>&#8211; Four colours are available so you&#8217;ll find one perfect for your style needs.<br \/>\n&#8211; Lightweight and portable for convenience.<br \/>\n&#8211; Never lose it with the portable hook, you can attach it to your backpack, belt loop, keys or handbag.<br \/>\n&#8211; Easy cleaning with a collapsible cleaning brush.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Material:<\/strong> 304 Stainless Steel.<br \/>\n<strong>Size: <\/strong>11 x 1.5 cm<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other colours available<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/black-retractable-metal-straws\/\">Black Retractable Metal Straw<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/silver-retractable-metal-straw\/\">Silver Retractable Metal Straw<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/rose-gold-retractable-metal-straw\/\">Rose-Gold Retractable Metal Straw<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4487300 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"4487300\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;ekit_we_effect_on&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<p class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><strong>Why EcoEssentials Was Created<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a638dce elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"a638dce\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;ekit_we_effect_on&quot;:&quot;none&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<p>The EcoEssentials Store is a sustainable store that sells products for the environmentally-conscious consumer.
