These reusable facial pads replace the need for harmful single-use cotton pads and remove dirt, excess oils and makeup easily. Simply wet them and watch the magic happen as they wipe off makeup, dirt and grease in seconds.<\/p>\n<p>The microfiber material makes for an effective cleaning tool because the fibres are positively charged. Oil and Dirt are negatively charged so they are literally attracted to microfiber like a magnet.

Our reusable facial pads are not only more convenient, they are affordable.
