A packet of plastic pegs will last you a couple of months before becoming flimsy and eventually breaking and ending up in landfill, where they live for hundreds of years, polluting and adding toxins to the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Investing in a pack of our stainless steel pegs will last you for years. They are strong and durable and every person who invests in them is sparing the planet from millions of plastic pegs. It&#8217;s a no-brainer really!<\/p>\n<p>Our metal pegs 30 pack are perfect for eco-friendly enthusiasts who need high-quality products that look great, too!

Metal pegs make for a more environmentally friendly choice than plastic ones as they last much longer and thus require fewer materials to produce.<\/p>\n<p>As more people start making these types of environmental decisions, we will all be on track to living in a greener world.<\/p>\n<h2>Features of our Metal Pegs<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Significantly reduce the number of plastic pegs that end up in landfill.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial Strength Metal Pegs that will hold up to any task.<\/li>\n<li>Eco-friendly and long-lasting design for the earth-conscious consumer.<\/li>\n<li>Does not break or bend like plastic pegs.<\/li>\n<li>Rust-resistant, these pegs will withstand the harshest Australian conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Quality materials ensure they last forever<\/li>\n<li>Packaged in their own reusable drawstring bag for convenient storage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Material:<\/strong> Marine Grade <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stainless_steel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">316 Stainless Steel<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Size: <\/strong>5.8cm long with 1.7mm thick wire<\/p>\n<p>We are proud to say that all our packaging is eco-friendly, read more about our packaging <a href=\"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/our-packaging\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pure Planet&#8217; Metal Pegs are totally sustainable and built to last.
