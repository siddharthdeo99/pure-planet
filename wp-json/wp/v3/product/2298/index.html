They are made from stainless steel, making them stronger than plastic straws. This means they will last longer if you use them constantly or even if they get dropped on the ground!<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this, metal straws do not retain the flavours or odours of the previous drinks as paper straws do, so what\u2019s not to love?! This collapsible design means it\u2019s small and easy to carry plus it will never get lost thanks to the handy hook on it.<\/p>\n<p>Cleaning couldn\u2019t be easier, either: just unscrew to separate the brush while still attached to the straw! That double cleaning action makes for cleaner drinking \u2013 you don\u2019t need all those germs in your mouth after all!<\/p>\n<h4>Reusable Earbuds<\/h4>\n<p>These environmentally-friendly Reusable Earbuds are designed to last 1000+ uses, and with their versatile design, it\u2019s great for removing dirt yet soft enough to keep your sensitive areas clean. It even has one side specifically designed for makeup application \u2013 bonus points! All in all, this is the next big thing in bathroom products.<\/p>\n<h4>Reusable Makeup Remover Pads<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a way to take care of your skin without harming the environment, then our large reusable facial pads white are perfect for you!<\/p>\n<p>These reusable facial pads replace the need for harmful single-use cotton pads and remove dirt, excess oils and makeup easily. Simply wet them and watch the magic happen as they wipe off makeup, dirt and grease in seconds.<\/p>\n<p>The microfiber material makes for an effective cleaning tool because the fibres are positively charged. Oil and Dirt are negatively charged so they are literally attracted to microfiber like a magnet. Our reusable facial pads are 11cm, so you\u2019ll catch all the dirt from your face with just one pad instead of using multiple wipes.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are these reusable facial pads better for the environment, but they are also great for your wallet! Never buy makeup wipes or cotton pads again! You\u2019ll love how soft and gentle this product is on your skin, not a single thing will irritate you!<\/p>\n<p>Our reusable facial pads are a total game-changer. This is not an ordinary makeup remover, this one will leave you feeling soft and smooth. Suitable for all skin types, especially sensitive skin! These pads are all-natural and chemical-free.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spoil mum this Mother&#8217;s Day with our Mother&#8217;s Day Beauty Bundle!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2306,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_analytify_skip_tracking":false,"_kad_post_transparent":"default","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"default","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"default","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"default","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false},"product_cat":[58,70],"product_tag":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v3\/product\/2298"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v3\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2298"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2306"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2298"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=2298"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ecoessentials.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=2298"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
