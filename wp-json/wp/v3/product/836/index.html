So, you have to ask yourself which is better?<\/p>\n<p>A packet of plastic pegs will last you a couple of months before becoming flimsy and eventually breaking and ending up in landfill, where they live for hundreds of years, polluting and adding toxins to the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Investing in a pack of our stainless steel pegs will last you for years. They are strong and durable and every person who invests in them is sparing the planet from millions of plastic pegs.
